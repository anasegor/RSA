MODERN SURVEYING BASIC CONTROL SURVEYS
Geodetic surveys involve such extensive areas that allowance must
be made for the Earth’s curvature. Baseline measurements for classical
triangulation are therefore reduced to sea-level length to start computations,
and corrections are made for spherical excess in the angular determinations.
Geodetic operations are classified into four “orders”, according to accuracy, the
first-order surveys having the smallest permissible error. Primary triangulation
is performed under rigid specifications to assure first-order accuracy.
Efforts are now under way to extend and tie together existing continental
networks by satellite triangulation so as to facilitate the adjustment of all major
geodetic surveys into a single world datum and determine the size and shape
of the Earth spheroid with much greater accuracy than heretofore obtained.
At the same time, current national networks will be strengthened, while the
remaining amount of work to be done may be somewhat reduced. Satellite
triangulation became operational in the United States in 1963 with observations
by Rebound A-13, launched that year, and some prior work using the Echo 1
8
and Echo 2 passive reflecting satellites. The first satellite specifically designed
for geodetic work, Pageos 1, was launched in 1966.
A first requirement for topographic mapping of a given area is an adequate
pattern of horizontal and vertical control points, and an initial step is the
assembly of all such existing information. This consists of descriptions of
points for which positions (in terms of latitude and longitude) and elevations
above mean sea level have been determined. They are occasionally located
at some distance from the immediate project, in which case it is necessary to
expand from the existing work. This is usually done on second- or third-order
standards, depending upon the length of circuits involved.
The accuracy of survey measurements can be improved almost indefinitely
but only at increased cost. Accordingly, control surveys are used; these consist
of a comparatively few accurate measurements that cover the area of the project
and from which short, less accurate measurements are made to the objects
to be located. The simplest form of horizontal control is the traverse, which
consists of a series of marked stations connected by measured courses and the
measured angles between them. When such a series of distances and angles
returns to its point of beginning or begins and ends at stations of superior
(more accurate) control, it can be checked and the small errors of measurement
adjusted for mathematical consistency. By assuming or measuring a direction
of one of the courses and rectangular coordinates of one of the stations, the
rectangular coordinates of all the stations can be computed.
